    <p1>Chicken cutlets are really just thin pieces of boneless
         chicken that have been cut from a thick breast or pounded flat. 
         I typically purchase thinly-sliced chicken breasts or “chicken cutlets” at 
         the grocery store to save some time on the prep work. If you prefer, you can make your own chicken cutlets by slicing two larger boneless, skinless chicken breasts in half lengthwise. Pound the halved chicken breasts with a meat mallet or 
        rolling pin to an even thickness and use in the recipe as instructed.</p1>
