    <h4>Pan-Fried Asparagus Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 slices hearty white sandwich bread, torn into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pound medium-sized asparagus, woody end cut off</li>
        <li>Peanut or Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Pan-Fried Asparagus Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place 1/4 cup of flour in a shallow dish. Or you can use a paper plate for easy cleanup.</li>
        <li>Combine the 3 tablespoons flour, bread pieces, salt, pepper, and cayenne in a food processor and process until finely ground. Transfer mixture to a large ziptop bag.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs and 1 tablespoon of water in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Rinse asparagus, but do not dry. The water will help the flour to adhere. Coat them in flour, dip them in egg wash and then 2 or 3 at a time, place them in the bag and shake to coat with bread crumbs. Lay them on a baking sheet until ready to fry.</li>
        <li>Line a plate with paper towels and pour at least an inch of oil into a Dutch oven. Heat oil to 350 degrees. Fry asparagus in batches for 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown. and then place on paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
